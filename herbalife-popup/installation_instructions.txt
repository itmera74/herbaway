Installation instructions


The popup has been created to require as little configuration as possible to be included
on your website, but still give you the flexibility to control how it is installed if you
need it.

Follow the steps below to get the pop-up working on your site:

1.	Unzip the attached herbalife-popup.zip file. This will give you a folder called
	'herbalife-popup'

2.	Copy this folder and its contents to your webserver. If possible, you should copy
	it to the top level of your hosting (where your index files are). If you are unsure 
	of this, your web hosting partner or digital team will be able to help you.

3. 	If you leave the folder called 'herbalife-popup', and do not rename any of the files
	in that folder, then you do not need to open these files. If you do need to edit
	the name, or cannot put it in the top level of your hosting, then you will need to
	make some file changes - see section below 'how to change the name or path of the
	popup'.
	
4.	Include the following code in the footer of your website, directly above the </body>
	tag:
	
		<div id="herbalifepopup"></div>
		<script type='text/javascript' src='/herbalife-popup/js-include.js'></script>

5.	That should then be installation complete.


How to change the name or path of the popup

If for any reason you cannot leave the folder name as herbalife-popup, or you have to 
put it in a location other than the top level of your hosting, then you will need to
amend the following sections of the pop-up files and include code:

6.	In the code you include on your website:

		<div id="herbalifepopup"></div>
		<script type='text/javascript' src='/herbalife-popup/js-include.js'></script>
		
	You need to update the '/herbalife-popup/' URL to the one matching your chosen
	location.
